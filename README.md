## 📌 Project Overview
The **AutoWorth Predictor** is a data science project focused on predicting the resale price of used Toyota vehicles. By analyzing historical sales data, this project identifies the most significant factors affecting car prices, providing a data-driven tool for buyers, sellers, and automotive dealers.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Comprehensive visualization of data distribution and correlation between features (e.g., price vs. year vs. mileage).
* **Robust Preprocessing**: Implementation of data cleaning, handling outliers, and feature scaling to ensure model stability.
* **Feature Engineering**: Selection of critical features to improve model accuracy and reduce computational complexity.
* **Regression Modeling**: Training and fine-tuning multiple regression algorithms to achieve the best predictive performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
The model performance is evaluated using:
* **R-squared (R2)**: To measure how well the independent variables explain the variance in car prices.
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: To understand the average magnitude of prediction errors in actual currency units.

## 💻 Usage
1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/adolesans/Toyota-used-car-predictive-analytic.git](https://github.com/adolesans/Toyota-used-car-predictive-analytic.git)
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the Notebook**
    Open the Jupyter Notebook to view the full analysis and model training process.
